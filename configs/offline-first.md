# Offline-First Architecture Configuration

## Core Principles
- All functionality must work without internet connection
- Data sync is enhancement, not requirement
- Local-first data storage with PouchDB
- Client-side encryption before cloud sync
- Conflict resolution with user involvement

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use PouchDB for local database with CouchDB sync
- Implement queue system for offline operations
- Cache all user interface assets locally
- Provide clear offline/online indicators
- Handle sync conflicts gracefully with user choice

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for local operations first
- Minimize network dependencies
- Use efficient local indexing
- Implement background sync when possible
- Monitor battery usage on mobile platforms
